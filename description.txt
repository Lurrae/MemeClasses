Adds a variety of new classes to Terraria! They might not be balanced or even entirely viable, but at least they're there!

Currently-implemented classes:
Pulley Class - A class based entirely around climbing ropes. While climbing on a rope with a special pulley equipped in your pulley slot, you will unleash special attacks!
